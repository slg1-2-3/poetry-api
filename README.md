## Poetry API Project

### Introduction
- I wanted to make a simple api that can hold my favorite poems.
- This api should have normal CRUD capabilities (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Output should be a json response

Long Term Goals:
- Write to .txt file with appropriately formatted poem for download. 
- Security (username:password login with specific permissions) 

### Python Technology Stack 
- FastAPI 💡 (framework)
    - Uvicorn 🎠 (server)
- MySQL 🐬 (database)
