## Poetry API Project

### Introduction
- ✅ I wanted to make a simple api that can hold my favorite poems.
- ✅ This api should have normal CRUD capabilities 
    - Create Read, Update, Delete
- ✅ Output should be a json response

Long Term Goals:
- Security:
    - ✅ username:password login with database
    - ⏭️ Users with specific permissions (OAuth2)
- ⏭️ Write to .txt file with appropriately formatted poem for download. 


### Python Technology Stack 
- FastAPI 💡 (framework)
    - Uvicorn 🎠 (server)
- MySQL 🐬 (database)


### Learnings & Notable Things 
* FastAPI has great documentation to follow along and learn
* Was able to create a hashed basic auth (username + password) and validate with the database
